It's the whq'k sounds that are the trouble
I just Big Toe'd the cone
Does this make you cry Urban Tears?
I'll just Microsoft Sam it
I... LIKE... CUPS.
I'm looking forward to the twin towers
Let's watch people irradiate
Jihad the titty
I need to whack out my-knob-oly
Can I be a mouse?
No way, no therapy
But I want to be a planet
My toe is the same size as some healthy penises
You know what's weird...? Carbonation down your penis
Was that my goblin thoughts?
You have to be good at waiting, really fast
Stop screaming, we've already saved the NHS
Did she have an elbow?
Can I have one of those pyramids?
My feet were little Voldemorts
Hakuna my immune system
I want to speak to my water
Boomerangs come back on their own terms
It's a really beefy camel toe
Milk can go fuck itself
Secondary hindu's
It was invented by Adult Hitler
It only evolves if you shit on it
You're neuro-diverse
Cruella Dickville
The greasy poon
There's too much eew in the woo
Goku? Boyku?
Pizza Hut's not real
Support the Sol Rings
It's just Wuhan
Absolutely bointless
This looks like a Mew Two costume
The Russian politican, Snaphisnekov
You kiss so nice on the nose
Municipal water
Unicorns are feet sized
Do popes lay eggs?
Crotch falafel
Charlie's my fish tank
Let's not push our successes on people, Matthew
It's a single-action banana
The mange has come
The spot is a decoy
Everyone's a wanker
Once it's on your face-face
We live in a meatless simulation
The second brain
I'm a lighthouse
Korma knees
I can't unsee mustache
Manwell's got karma
I don't have a blachulars
You gotta keep your tongue above the top teeth
